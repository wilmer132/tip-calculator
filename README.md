## Notes

The interesting part of the assignment was the design of the app.
The programming aspect of this project seemed pretty straight forward. A big part of the challenge was overcoming the documentation that Android development carries with it in regards to app design.
However, the progress was very fun and has sparked an interest in me to continue.
